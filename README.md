- A 3d lib representing a Point3d and basic Vector3d operations coded in Rust
  for basic and fast 3d computation with a convinient 'micro 3d engine' 
  allowing graphical representation of the virtual space.
- This repo is not inteded to be a public demonstartion
  it's my personal work for my personal need this repo is public but i don't
  comunicate on it (this will not serve my personal interest or those of some one else)
  so why it's public ? then i have nothing to hide and vertue is to pull collective knowledge
  up where there is the will to involve yourself in something that may be hard
  some time to understand.
  because at some point this kind of stuff ask for all of your time.
  no matter if IA help you or not to refactorize your code...  you have to
  understand for driving no choice...
- A world with clever people needing each other for me it's a better world !
  and the cold ia is just a subsequent part of that.
- So if you are there better for you to be ready to work and keep it mind this
  place is a ghost place this repo does not really exsit beyound your understanding
  if there is understanding please keep in mind that we need each other and colective
  knowledge which serve only to build a better world together, without us or the cloud of us
  there is only selffishness, war and limitation of small interest please think at that.
