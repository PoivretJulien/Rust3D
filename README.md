- Update are personal and does not mean a working code, this repository is public but not intended to be public !


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- A 3D library representing a Point3d and basic Vector3d operations coded in Rust for basic and 
fast 3D computation with a convenient 'micro 3D engine' allowing graphical representation of the virtual space.
- This repository is not intended to be a public demonstration. It’s my personal work for my personal needs.
- This repository is public but I don't communicate about it (this will not serve my personal interests or those of anyone else).
- Why is it public, then? Because I have nothing to hide, and virtue is to pull collective knowledge up
  where there is the will to involve yourself in something that may sometimes be hard to understand.
- Because at some point, this kind of stuff asks for all of your time.
  No matter if AI helps you or not to refactor your code... you have to understand for driving—no choice.
- A world with clever people needing each other is for me, a better world!
  And the cold AI is just a subsequent part of that.
- So if you are there, better for you to be ready to work. And keep in mind this place is a ghost place.
  This repository does not really exist beyond your understanding. If there is understanding,
  please keep in mind that we need each other and collective knowledge, which serves only to build a
  better world together. Without us or the cloud of us, there is only selfishness, war,
  and limitation of small interests. Please think about that.
